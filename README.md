# Property-Price-Predictor-Enhancing-Zillow-s-Home-Value-Estimates-using-Three-Way-Decision
The "Property Price Predictor" project aimed to revolutionize Zillow's Home Value Estimates by developing a sophisticated machine learning model capable of predicting log errors and implementing a robust three-way decision framework. This comprehensive report details the project's journey, the initial weeks' groundwork to the model development, and the final recommendations. The report encompasses critical aspects such as the dataset characteristics, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, and a thorough evaluation of the models using the three-way decision framework. The ultimate goal is to provide stakeholders with actionable insights and a roadmap for implementing an advanced property price prediction system.

# Introduction 
## 1.1 Background and Motivation
Real estate valuation is a complex task pivotal in decision-making processes for homeowners, buyers, and investors. Zillow, a prominent player in the real estate market, employs automated valuation models (AVMs) to estimate property values. The motivation behind this project lies in the continuous pursuit of improving the accuracy and transparency of these estimates. Introducing a three-way decision framework adds a layer of sophistication to the existing methodology, allowing for more nuanced and reliable predictions.

## 1.2 Objectives and Scope
The primary objective is to enhance Zillow's Home Value Estimates by developing a machine learning model capable of predicting log errors. The project's scope extends beyond traditional valuation methods, incorporating a three-way decision framework to categorize predictions as underestimated, accurate, or overestimated. This framework introduces a dynamic approach to decision-making, aligning the model's predictions with industry best practices.

## 1.3 Significance of Three-Way Decision Framework
The significance of the three-way decision framework lies in its ability to provide a structured approach to decision-making in real estate valuation. By classifying predictions into three categories, stakeholders can better understand the model's performance. This framework is particularly relevant in scenarios where the consequences of underestimation or overestimation have varying impacts. For instance, an underestimated property value might lead to missed opportunities for sellers, while an overestimated value could deter potential buyers.
